## Installation

[Download from CurseForge]() if you plan to install it in your mods folder as a dependency.

If you are using MCGUI in your mod, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url = "https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/px01tv/hubbajub/"
    }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "io.px:mcgui:[version]"
}
```

The end user will be required to download MCGUI from [CurseForge](), this supports us through [CurseForge's reward program.]()

However, you may jar-in-jar MCGui if downloading from [CurseForge]() is impractical for your mod.

## Getting Started

TBD

## What happened to the old MCGUI?

The old creator of MCGUI vanished, they deleted the GitHub repository and invalidated any forks. Luckily, forks were not deleted, allowing us to revive MCGUI.
